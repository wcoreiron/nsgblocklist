# Automated Network Security Script

## Introduction

In the digital age, robust cybersecurity is non-negotiable. This script is an automated solution against network threats, leveraging VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, GitHub, and Azure SDK to deliver a comprehensive defense mechanism. It's designed to save time and increase accuracy for network administrators in the fight against cyber threats.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with a repository for the IP blocklist.
- VirusTotal API access for IP security intelligence.
- An AbuseIPDB account to reference a database of reported IP abuses.
- An Azure subscription with permissions to manage NSG configurations.

## Script Mechanism

### IP Blocklist Retrieval
The script begins by pulling a list of known malicious IPs from a designated GitHub repository.

### User Interaction for IP Analysis
Users input an IP address for inspection, which might be flagged by their security systems.

### VirusTotal Analysis
The script analyzes the IP against VirusTotal's databases using various antivirus tools.

### AbuseIPDB Check
It checks the IP against AbuseIPDB's documented history of malicious activities.

### Country and Flag Identification
The script identifies the IP's geographic location using ipapi.co, falling back on VirusTotal data if needed, and attempts to display the corresponding flag emoji.

### GitHub Blocklist Update
Users can update the GitHub blocklist with the malicious IP or its range after analysis.

### NSG Update
The script updates Azure NSGs to block the identified malicious IP/range using the Azure SDK.

### Multiple API Keys Rotation
It uses several API keys in rotation to avoid hitting VirusTotal's rate limits.

### Modularity and Reusability
The script is modular, with discrete, reusable functions for flexibility and ease of updates.

### Automation and Progress Tracking
Enhances user experience with real-time progress tracking through a progress bar and console messages.

### Error Handling and Logging
Includes error handling to alert users of any issues, ensuring continuity of operations.

### Security Rule Management
Manages NSG rule limits efficiently, creating additional rules as necessary for new IP blocks.

## Execution

Run the script to initiate a user-friendly interface that guides through the IP analysis process, with options to block IPs on GitHub or within Azure NSGs.

## Conclusion

Automation is key in cybersecurity. This script is a prime example of how it can enhance network security while reducing administrative efforts.
